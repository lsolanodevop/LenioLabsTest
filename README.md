# Basic
The solution is pretty standard.
Everything is divided in folders.
I am using 3 POM's with the functions so it just has to be invoked in the test file
Strong Points:
- Some Locators are dinamyc
- It's pretty segmented so is easier to read
- Has enough assertions to check that everything is working properly
  

To Execute:
- Switch to the proper Branch "dualBoot"
- Do the npm install - update
- Be sure to have Playwright installed if not do npm install playwright
- If wanted you could use npm run test to run the available test
